# Two Sum Problem: Step-by-Step Guide

## **Overview**

The **Two Sum** problem is a classic interview question. You're given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, and you need to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Your task is to return the indices of the two numbers, not the numbers themselves. There’s always exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

The challenge lies in optimizing your solution to be as efficient as possible.

## **Problem Statement**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices** of the two numbers that add up to the target.

### **Constraints:**
- The array `nums` has a length between 2 and 10^4.
- Each element in `nums` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9.
- The target is also between -10^9 and 10^9.
- There is always **exactly one solution**.
- You may not use the same element twice (i.e., you can’t use the same index twice).

### **Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1] (since nums[0] + nums[1] = 9)
```

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

Before jumping into coding, make sure you fully understand the problem. You are given:
1. An array `nums`.
2. A `target` value.
3. You need to return the **indices** of two elements from `nums` that sum up to the target value.

You cannot use the same element twice, meaning you can't sum the same number with itself unless it's repeated in the array.

**Things to consider:**
- What happens if the array is small?
- What if it's very large?
- How could we improve performance for larger arrays?

### **Step 2: Brute Force Approach**

A brute-force solution involves checking every pair of numbers in the array to see if they sum to the target.

**Questions to think about:**
- What’s the time complexity of this approach?
- How would you implement this? (Hint: Think about nested loops.)
- Can you optimize this approach?

You can start by writing this brute-force solution as a learning exercise. While it’s not optimal, it’s a good starting point.

### **Step 3: Improving the Time Complexity**

The brute-force approach will have a time complexity of **O(n²)** because for each element, you are checking every other element in the array.

Now, think about how you can improve this:
- Instead of looking at every possible pair, could you store some information to avoid recalculating or checking every pair?
- How could you track whether a number's complement (i.e., `target - current number`) exists in the array without rechecking everything?

This is where a **hash map** (or a dictionary) comes into play.

### **Step 4: Using a Hash Map**

A **hash map** allows you to store elements and their indices in a way that lets you check if a number’s complement exists in **constant time**, O(1).

**Plan:**
1. Loop through the array once.
2. For each element in the array:
   - Calculate its complement: `target - current number`.
   - Check if the complement exists in the hash map:
     - If it does, you’ve found your pair! Return their indices.
     - If not, add the current number and its index to the hash map.
   
Think about why this approach would have **O(n)** time complexity. The hash map lookup and insertion both take constant time.

### **Step 5: Edge Cases**

Even though the problem guarantees that there’s exactly one solution, it’s important to consider edge cases for robustness:
- What happens if the array contains negative numbers?
- What if multiple pairs of numbers add up to the target? (Remember, you only need one solution.)
- What if the array has repeating numbers?

Writing some test cases for these scenarios can help you understand your code’s behavior.

### **Step 6: Code Implementation**

Now that you have a plan, start coding the solution. Use the following outline to help you:

1. **Initialize a hash map.**
2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each number, calculate the complement.
   - Check if the complement exists in the hash map.
   - If it exists, return the indices.
   - Otherwise, store the current number and its index in the hash map.
3. **Return the result.**

### **Step 7: Analyze Your Solution**

Once you’ve implemented your solution:
- What is the time complexity? (Hint: it should be O(n).)
- What is the space complexity? (Hint: it should also be O(n) because of the hash map.)

Think about why this solution is more efficient than the brute-force approach.

### **Step 8: Optimize and Test**

- **Optimize:** Try to minimize redundant calculations. Ensure that your code is clear and concise.
- **Test:** Create a few test cases based on the example inputs and additional edge cases (e.g., large arrays, negative numbers, etc.).
